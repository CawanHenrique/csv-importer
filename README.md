# CSV Contact Importer

A Laravel + Vue.js application that allows importing contacts from a CSV (or Excel) file, deduplicating by email, validating fields, and displaying a processing summary with a paginated contact list.

This project was developed as part of the Alberon technical test.

## ‚úÖ Automated Tests

This project includes automated tests written with **Pest** (the default testing framework in Laravel 11).

### Unit-style tests (implemented as Feature Tests)
We verify the behavior of the `ContactImporter` service with different scenarios:

- **Imports valid CSV rows**  
  Ensures that valid rows are processed and persisted in the database.

- **Ignores duplicate emails inside the file**  
  Ensures that rows with the same email are only imported once, and duplicates are tracked in the summary.

- **Skips invalid rows**  
  Ensures that rows missing required fields or with invalid data (e.g. invalid email, wrong date format) are not persisted.

### Feature test (full integration)
We simulate the real upload process through the application:

- **Uploads and imports a CSV file via endpoint**  
  Creates a fake file and posts it to the `/contacts/import` endpoint, verifying that:
  - The request redirects on success (`302`).
  - The expected number of contacts are saved in the database.

### Running the tests
```bash
php artisan test
```
